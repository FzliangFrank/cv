I aim to achive this by start working as a *Data Engineer* and challenge myself with heavier data volume.
Outside work, I enjoy art and music. I share digital drawings on my instagram.

    - Restore historical version of data using change logs table without datetime database in pure PostgreSQL;

- Experience appying natual language processing (in commercial experience) and long paragraphs (Latent Dirichlet Allocation for my acdemic project).
